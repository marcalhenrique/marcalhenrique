## About

Computer Vision Engineer focused on building end-to-end AI systems for real-world and industrial environments.

My work spans the full lifecycle of machine learning solutions — from model development (detection, OCR, tracking) to production deployment with proper software architecture and MLOps practices.

I value robustness, scalability, and engineering quality as much as model accuracy.
